# Sukkaito's Bookmarklet
My [bookmarket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet) to quickly perform actions with Javascript.

## Setup:
Using lambda expression, we can achive our goal with something like this:
```js
javascript: (() => {<Your code goes here>})();
```
Make a new bookmark, replace the URL with the code above, pin it to somewhere reachable and you're good to go!

## Contributing
These scripts were made to feed my laziness. PRs are welcome!
